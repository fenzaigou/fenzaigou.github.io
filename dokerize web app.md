Firstly, I try to dockerize an vinilla vite project, but I failed to expose the port.

I thought it was my fault, but when I dockerize react vite app and nextjs app, it works well.

Suddenly I understand that it is the vinilla vite project has problem. 

And now I am trying to dockerize my static html page with httpd.

Fingers crossed for that!
